# Hi, I'm Henrique  ðŸ‘‹

## Small stuff about me:
I am an informatics engineering graduate from [**FEUP**][website] <br>
Some of my interests include game development and general software development, mainly for back-end applications. I am always seeking new ways to enhance my skills and optimize my coding practices.<br>
In my free time, I like to play games and go out with friends, as well as play card games at my local game store (mainly Yu-Gi-Oh).<br>
This GitHub page showcases a collection of my college projects and exercises completed over the yearsâ€”feel free to explore!
